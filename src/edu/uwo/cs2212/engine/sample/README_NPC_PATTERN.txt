NPC/Character implementation pattern
------------------------------------
- Create your character's GameCharacter in GameLoader.sampleGame().
- Add any GiveRule(s) your character supports.
- If your character should unlock paths, use UseRule on objects or
  return objects that represent keys/switches.
- Add your character's id to a Location.characterIds list.
